# Image-Classification-web-app

A browser-based AI project that allows users to upload, label, and train a custom image classification model using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet. The model is trained entirely on the client side without any backend, making it lightweight and accessible. This project helped me explore the basics of machine learning, frontend-AI integration, and client-side deep learning.
